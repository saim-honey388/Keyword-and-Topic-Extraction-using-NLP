# **Keyword and Topic Extraction Tool**

## **Overview**
This project is an NLP-based tool designed to extract key phrases and topics from text data.
It supports multiple input formats, including URLs, PDF files, and Word documents.
The tool preprocesses the input text, removes stop words, and extracts keywords using TF-IDF, while identifying relevant topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

## **Features**
- **Multi-source Input Support**: Works with URLs, PDF files, and Word documents.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Performs tokenization, lemmatization, and removes stop words using spaCy.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Uses TF-IDF to extract the most important key phrases from the text.
- **Topic Modeling**: Implements LDA for identifying dominant topics in the text.
- **Customizable Outputs**: The number of keywords and topics extracted can be adjusted as needed.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Natural Language Processing (spaCy, NLTK)**
- **Text Mining (TF-IDF, LDA)**
- **Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Requests)**
- **PDF Parsing (PyPDF2)**
- **Word Parsing (python-docx)**
- **Google Colab** for running the project.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saim-honey388/Keyword-and-Topic-Extraction-using-NLP.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the necessary `spaCy` model:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## **Usage**
1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python extract_keywords_topics.py
   ```

2. Choose your input method:
   - **URL**: Enter the URL of the article or blog.
   - **PDF File**: Provide the path to the PDF file.
   - **Word File**: Provide the path to the Word document.

3. The tool will output:
   - Key phrases based on TF-IDF.
   - Topics generated by LDA.

## **Example**
### Input:
- A URL pointing to a news article, a PDF, or a Word document.
  
### Output:
- **Key Phrases**: The top 10 most relevant key phrases.
- **Topics**: The top 3 topics with their related words.

## **How It Works**
- **Text Extraction**: Text is extracted from the provided input source (URL, PDF, or Word file).
- **Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned, tokenized, lemmatized, and stop words are removed.
- **Keyword Extraction**: TF-IDF is used to rank and extract key phrases.
- **Topic Extraction**: LDA is used to generate topics from the text.

## **How It Helped Me**
This project enhanced my understanding of text mining, keyword extraction, and topic modeling using NLP techniques. It also helped me gain practical experience working with different input formats like URLs, PDF, and Word files.
